        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
          This Privacy Policy describes how Panel Guardian ("we," "us," or
          "our") collects, uses, and discloses information in connection with
          your use of the Panel Guardian mobile application ("the App").
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
          We take your privacy very seriously. Our App is designed solely to
          display data from your connected panel system.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">
          1. Information We Collect
        </h3>
        <p>The App does not collect any personal information from you.</p>
        <p>
          All panel status updates, sensor readings originate from your IoT
          device.
        </p>
        <p>
          That data is transmitted by your device to our backend on AWS. The App
          fetches this information securely from AWS and displays it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The App may require access to your local network to establish outbound
          HTTPS connections to AWS. No data is sent directly to us from within
          the App.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">
          2. How We Use Information
        </h3>
        <p>
          We use the data retrieved from AWS only to present real-time status
          and historical readings of your panel system.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not analyze, aggregate, or share your data for any other
          purpose.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">
          3. Data Storage and Security
        </h3>
        <p>
          Your IoT device pushes data to our AWS infrastructure. That data is
          stored in encrypted form at rest.
        </p>
        <p>All communications between the App and AWS occur over HTTPS/TLS.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">
          4. SMS Notifications and Phone Number Privacy
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you opt in to receive SMS notifications by providing your mobile
          phone number and checking the consent checkbox during account
          creation, we collect only your phone number for the purpose of sending
          Panel Guardian device alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, rent, distribute, or trade
          your phone number or SMS opt-in consent data with any third parties
          for marketing, advertising, or any other purpose. Your phone number is
          used solely to deliver transactional alerts from the Panel Guardian
          service and will never be shared with affiliates or third parties
          except as required by law.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">
          5. Third-Party Services
        </h3>
        <p>
          We rely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host, store, and serve your
          panel data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or
          data-collection services.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">6. Your Consent</h3>
        <p>
          By using the Panel Guardian App, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
          If you do not agree with these terms, please discontinue use of the
          App.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700">
          7. Changes to this Privacy Policy
        </h3>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
          you of significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within
          the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Policy
          periodically.
        </p>
